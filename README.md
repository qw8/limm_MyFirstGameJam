# limm
 A simple game made for [MyFirstGameJam: Winter 2017](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-winter-2017/) edition. It's written in JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. Game's page on itch.io is [this one](https://qw8.itch.io/limm).
 
 The repo also has a [level editor](tools/tilemap_editor), but it is cumbersome to use and the UI is outright awful.
 
 ## limm uses:
 * [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for basic canvas manipulation and event handling.
 * [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) and [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for the level editor.

## softwave used:
 [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) for creating sounds.
 [piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/) for sprites.
