# limm
 A simple game made for [MyFirstGameJam: Winter 2017](https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-winter-2017/) edition. It's written in JavaScript using HTML5 canvas.
 
You can play it on the [game's itch.io page](https://souserge.itch.io/limm), or you can test the [latest commited version](https://souserge.github.io/limm/).
 
 The repo also has a [level editor](https://souserge.github.io/limm/tools/tilemap_editor/index.html), but it is cumbersome to use and the UI is outright awful.
 
## limm uses:
 * [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for basic canvas manipulation and event handling.
 * [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) and [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) for the level editor.

## software used:
 * [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) for creating sounds.
 * [piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/) for sprites.

  - [ ] Embed the level editor into the game
  - [ ] Add game states (e.g. changing the appearance of levels according to the progress)
  - [ ] Add animations
  - [ ] Add a death counter
  - [ ] Add/update sounds (e.g. game_complete sound)
  - [ ] Add a soundtrack (I'm thinking of a light bossa-nova vibe)
  - [ ] Add the ability to transition between levels without doors
  - [ ] Add more types of tiles
  - [ ] Add a mouse/touch screen support
  - [ ] Add a "secrects found" counter
