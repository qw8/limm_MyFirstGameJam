## TODO:
  - [ ] consider moving to a game engine (but remember that it's not cool)
  - [ ] what's up with delta time?
  - [ ] think about scaling the game (static size vs scaling)
  - [ ] optimize. EVERY. THING.
  - [ ] the player is sometimes stuck in walls, needs a fix (optimize the collision system)
  - [ ] change the current movement mechanics to something less frustrating (add impusle (jerk) when changing directions)
  - [ ] add a level system to support changing level rooms
  - [ ] add an event handler
  - [ ] reconsider mechanics (forget about acceleration? dynamic map? moar random?)
  - [ ] refactor the code (constants)
  - [ ] make more expended classes; add settings to existing ones
  - [ ] add text boxes

### For the future (DO NOT LOOK PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE LIST ABOVE):
  * reconsider mechanics
  * add fight mechanics
  * add other objects (e.g. items, spikes, checkpoints, chests, etc.)
  * add death mechanics
  * add a scoring system
  * reconsider mechanics
  * add NPCs (basic movement script/AI)
  * add textures
  * add a level editor (will ease the work dramatically)
  * add sound effects
  * add textures
  * reconsider mechanics
  * write a plot (set the goal, write some dialogues, quests etc.)
  * too late to reconsider mechanics, should've done earlier
