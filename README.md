A rougelike with a stupid name and no concept.

## TODO:
  * consider moving to a game engine (but remember that it's not cool)
  * what's up with delta time?
  * think about scaling the game (static size vs scaling)
  * optimize. EVERY. THING.
  * the player is sometimes stuck in walls, needs a fix
  * (related to the previous) optimize the collision system
  * change the current movement mechanics to something less frustrating (add impusle (jerk) when changind directions)
  * add a level system to support changing level rooms
  * add an event handler
  * reconsider mechanics (forget about acceleration? dynamic map? moar random?)
  * refactor the code (constants)
  * make more expended classes; add settings to existing ones
  * add text boxes

### For the future (DO NOT LOOK PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE LIST ABOVE):
  * reconsider mechanics
  * add fight mechanics
  * add other objects (e.g. items, spikes, checkpoints, chests, etc.)
  * add death mechanics
  * add a scoring system
  * reconsider mechanics
  * add NPCs (basic movement script/AI)
  * add textures
  * add a level editor (will ease the work dramatically)
  * add sound effects
  * add textures
  * reconsider mechanics
  * write a plot (set the goal, write some dialogues, quests etc.)
  * too late to reconsider mechanics, should've done earlier
